# my-first-lm
This project is my first time learning about training and fine-tuning language models (LMs). 

## Goals
The goal is to be able to learn about LM architecture, train LMs, and take existing LMs and fine-tune them to custom datasets.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is research that I want to do comparing SLMs and LLMs. Additionally, LMs are an area of interest for me, so I want to learn more about how to work with them in a somewhat real-world example.
